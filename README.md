## Abstract
There are various sources of ionizing radiation exposure, where medical exposure for radiation therapy or diagnosis is the most common human-made source. Understanding how gene expression is modulated after ionizing radiation exposure and investigating the presence of any dose-dependent gene expression patterns have broad implications for health risks from radiotherapy, medical radiation diagnostic procedures, as well as other environmental exposure. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive pathway-based analysis of gene expression profiles in response to low-dose radiation exposure, in order to examine the potential mechanism of gene regulation underlying such responses. To accomplish this goal, we employ a statistical framework to determine whether a specific group of genes belonging to a known pathway display coordinated expression patterns that are modulated in a manner consistent with the radiation level. Findings in our study suggest that there exist complex yet consistent signatures that reflect the molecular response to radiation exposure, which differ between low-dose and high-dose radiation.
